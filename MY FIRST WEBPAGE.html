				<p class="introduction"> A friend is a person who is always there when you need him / her.<br /> When we are so close to our friends, our minds communicate with each other even before we talk.
						Birthdays are always special to friends, because they meet each other and celebrate like never before. <a href="#happybirthday">Below is an old birthday poem to my dear friend</a> <br />

				<h3> HAPPY BIRTHDAY </h3>
					<p >Each day we get older,<br />
					Every second is like an almond to us,<br />
					Every hour we store like a precious treasure in our memories,<br />
					Every month we cherish like a pearl,<br />
					Every year we celebrate our talents.<br />
					</p>				
					<p>But today we celebrate your birthday,<br />
					In order to recall our past and present,<br />
					And also think about the future,<br />
					At this time we celebrate our true character,<br />
					We will always remember our loved ones, friends, enemies and relations.<br />
					</p>				
					<p>Today we celebrate peace and harmony,<br />
					Today we celebrate love and compassion,<br />
					Today we celebrate hope and charity,<br />
					Today we celebrate our faith in GOD,<br />
					HAPPY BIRTHDAY.<br />
